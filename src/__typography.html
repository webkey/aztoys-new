        <p>Like many new graduates, Dallas Roberts wanted to celebrate the end of his studies at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, with a trip. His proposed destination: Philadelphia, where he could attend the Democratic National Convention to support Bernie Sanders. The 22-year-old couldn't afford the $3,000 he estimated the trip would cost. So he did what many people of his generation would do. He turned to crowdfunding website GoFundMe. In just under a month, Roberts raised $1,500, enough to cover his $545 flight and a $380 per-night hotel room, which he's sharing with two other delegates. "You have to come up with funds one way or another," Roberts told me in a phone conversation last week before making the trip to Philadelphia. "Without the GoFundMe campaign and the generous contributions from friends and supporters, I wouldn't have been able to do this."</p>

        <div class="note">
          <p>Roberts isn't alone. Delegates are expected to foot the bill themselves, and attending the DNC is expensive. Organizers require delegates to stay at specific hotels that range in price from $300 to $600 a night, depending on how close they are to the convention center. Then there are flights, meals and the occasional tipple. Add it all up and being on hand for Hillary Clinton's crowning will likely cost many delegates more than $4,000.</p>

        <p>Когда от милой моей долины поднимается пар и полдневное солнце стоит над непроницаемой чащей темного леса и лишь редкий луч проскальзывает в его святая святых, а я лежу в высокой траве у быстрого ручья и, прильнув к земле, вижу тысячи всевозможных былинок и чувствую, как близок моему сердцу крошечный мирок, что снует между стебельками, наблюдаю эти неисчислимые, непостижимые разновидности червяков и мошек и чувствую близость всемогущего, создавшего нас по своему подобию, веяние вселюбящего, судившего нам парить в вечном блаженстве, когда взор мой туманится и все вокруг меня и небо надо мной запечатлены в моей душе, точно образ возлюбленной, - тогда, дорогой друг, меня часто томит мысль: "Ах!</p>
        <p>Как бы выразить, как бы вдохнуть в рисунок то, что так полно, так трепетно живет во мне, запечатлеть отражение моей души, как душа моя - отражение предвечного бога! " Друг мой. . . Но нет! Мне не под силу это, меня подавляет величие этих явлений.</p>
